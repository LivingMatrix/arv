- Make parsing safe
  - detect overflow while parsing integers
  - use fuzzing (afl, e.g.) to break the parser
- Benchmark other ops
  - iteration
  - random access
- Modify google dense hash map to move/emplace from buffer
  - try to use a nearly full buffer to make this faster
- Try to move y-chromo detection out of the loop
- Remove the pimpl pattern, don't need it anymore
