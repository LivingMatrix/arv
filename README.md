arv â€” a fast 23andMe parser for Python
======================================

Arv (Norwegian; "inheritance") is a Python module for parsing raw 23andMe
genome files. It lets you lookup SNPs from RSIDs:

    import arv

    genome = arv.load("genome.txt")

    print("You are a {gender} with {eyecolor} and {complexion} skin.".format(
      gender     = "man" if genome.y_chromosome else "woman",
      complexion = "light" if genome["rs1426654"] == "AA" else "dark",
      eyecolor   = arv.unphased_match(genome["rs12913832"], {
                      "AA": "brown eyes",
                      "AG": "brown or green eyes",
                      "GG": "blue eyes"})))

In my case, this little program produces

    You are a man with blue eyes and light skin.

It's insanely fast: On a 2013 Xeon machine, a 24 Mb file is fully
parsed and put into a hash table in less than 70 ms. Its guts are written in
finely tuned C++ and is exposed to Python via Cython.

Status
======

*This project is currently just a work in progress! I intend to wrap dna-traits
under a new name, using Cython to interface with dna-traits much more easily.*

*For a working (but old) version, see https://github.com/cslarsen/dna-traits*

Installation
============

The recommended way is to install from PyPi:

    $ pip install arv

*NOTE: This is not yet available!*

You can also build from source. In that case, you need a C++ compiler with
C++11 support, CMake and Cython:

    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake .. -GNinja \
      -DARV_PYTHON_VERSION=2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
    $ ccmake . # optional, for changing settings
    $ ninja

You can change which Python version to compile for with the CMake cache
variable `ARV_PYTHON_VERSION`, for example `cmake -DARV_PYTHON_VERSION=2
[...]`.

Requirements
------------

  * A C++ compiler
  * A UNIX system
  * CMake 3.5 or newer
  * Cython: `pip install cython`
