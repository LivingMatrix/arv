arv â€” a fast 23andMe parser for Python
======================================

Arv (Norwegian; "inheritance" or "heritage") is a Python module for parsing raw
23andMe genome files. It lets you lookup SNPs from RSIDs::

    from arv import load, unphased_match as match

    genome = load("genome.txt")

    print("You are a {gender} with {color} eyes and {complexion} skin.".format(
      gender     = "man" if genome.y_chromosome else "woman",
      complexion = "light" if genome["rs1426654"] == "AA" else "dark",
      eyecolor   = match(genome["rs12913832"], {"AA": "brown",
                                                "AG": "brown or green",
                                                "GG": "blue"})))

In my case, this little program produces::

    You are a man with blue eyes and light skin.

It's insanely fast: On a 2013 Xeon machine, a 24 Mb file is fully parsed and
put into a hash table in less than 70 ms. Its guts are written in finely tuned
C++ and is exposed to Python via Cython.

Status
======

> This project is currently just a work in progress! I intend to wrap dna-traits
under a new name, using Cython to interface with dna-traits much more easily.

> For a working (but old) version, see https://github.com/cslarsen/dna-traits*

Installation
============

The recommended way is to install from PyPi::

    $ pip install arv

**NOTE: This is not yet available!**

You can also build from source. In that case, you need a C++ compiler with
C++11 support, CMake and Cython::

    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake .. -GNinja \
      -DARV_PYTHON_VERSION=2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
    $ ccmake . # optional, for changing settings
    $ ninja

You can change which Python version to compile for with the CMake cache
variable `ARV_PYTHON_VERSION`, for example `cmake -DARV_PYTHON_VERSION=2
[...]`. If you have several versions of Python installed on your machine, e.g.
3.3 and 3.4 and so on, you are advised to specify both major and minor version
here, for example `ARV_PYTHON_VERSION=3.3`.

Requirements
------------

  * A C++ compiler with C++11 support
  * A UNIX system
  * Optional: CMake 3.5 or newer
  * Cython: `pip install cython`
